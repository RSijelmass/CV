A Full-Stack developer with a passion for science. I have finished both a BSc in Earth Sciences and an MSc in Geoscience, where I decided to mostly focus on Hydrology – the research of water. I felt it was important to understand the planet we live on. Now I converted to the techworld as that will help me understand the future; I strive to make it a full-time passion in a place where I can be both be challenged and a contribution. At the end of the day, two things make me come to work every morning with a smile: the problems at hand to solve, and the impact those solutions will bring. 

The path to becoming a developer started when touching modelling / programming tools throughout my academic career, where we touched on technologies as MATLAB, ArcGIS, R, MikeZero and SMS. The developing train really took off, however, after starting a 16-week intense bootcamp called [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com). A lot of focus is placed here on agile working, pair programming, and test driven development.

## Skills

### Resilient

**Working in a sales environment**

Being in a sales environment, if anything, builds resilience. Hearing a lot of people saying no, but having the proper mind-set to brush it off and assume the next call or conversation will be a yes. I sold mainly to the Dutch market, and appreciated the no-nonsense mind-set they often take on.

### Agile

**Thesis Research in India.**

I conducted the research for my bachelor’s thesis in Chennai, India to analyse water contamination in a major wetland. Here, nothing went as planned; they took away my previously given rights to take samples in the wetland, and half of the equipment in the laboratory that was promised me didn’t function. I managed to fulfil my research and extended it with new data and a new research approach nonetheless.

### Drive / Determination

**Volunteering at an animal shelter**

Animals that have been saved from the slaughterhouse, or any other cruel environment, are cared for at the F.R.I.E.N.D. Animal Sanctuary just outside of London. Here, I’ve spent numerous days in the weekends doing various tasks; building and/or cleaning sheds, feeding the animals, planting new crop, etc. 

### Communication

**Director of a play**

As a director, nothing is more important than communication; you are putting together your vision, where your canvas consists of living people. It is necessary to both steer the ship yet give space for the actors to flourish their creative expression.

**Tutoring high school kids**

Tutoring teenagers to pass their final high school exams (Physics / Chemistry / Maths). This was intense, as it was 1-on-1 tutoring, but extremely rewarding. Getting the students to do their homework and aim for a seemingly distant reward is challenging, but very much worth it.
