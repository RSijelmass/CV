A Full-Stack developer with a passion for science, tech and anything that sparks up my brain really. I have finished both a BSc in Earth Sciences and an MSc in Geoscience, where I decided to mostly focus on Hydrology – the research of water. I felt it was important to understand the planet we live on. Now I converted to the techworld as that will help me understand the future; I strive to make it a full-time passion in a place where I can be both be challenged and a contribution. At the end of the day, two things make me come to work every morning with a smile: the problems at hand to solve, and the impact those solutions will bring. 

The path to becoming a developer started when touching upon modelling / programming tools throughout my academic career, where we came across technologies as MATLAB, ArcGIS, R, MikeZero and SMS. The developing train really took off, however, after starting a 16-week intense bootcamp called [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com). A lot of focus is placed here on agile working, pair programming, and test driven development. If you'll ask me what Makers Academy has taught me, I'll respond saying that above anything they have taught me to see my code not just as a passive skill to own; but instead as an art form that needs to be worked on every day.

## Skills

### Resilient

**Working in a sales environment**

Being in a sales environment, if anything, builds resilience. Hearing a lot of people saying no, but having the proper mind-set to brush it off and assume the next call or conversation will be a yes. I sold mainly to the Dutch market, and appreciated the no-nonsense mind-set they often take on.

### Flexible

**Thesis Research in India.**

I conducted the research for my bachelor’s thesis in Chennai, India to analyse water contamination in a major wetland. Here, nothing went as planned; they took away my previously given rights to take samples in the wetland, and half of the equipment in the laboratory didn’t function. I managed to fulfil my research and extended it with new data and a new research approach nonetheless.

### Drive / Determination

**Volunteering at an animal shelter**

Animals that have been saved from the slaughterhouse, or any other cruel environment, are cared for at the F.R.I.E.N.D. Animal Sanctuary just outside of London. Here, I’ve spent numerous days in the weekends doing various tasks; building and/or cleaning sheds, feeding the animals, planting new crop, etc. 

### Communication

**Director of a play**

As a director, nothing is more important than communication; you are putting together your vision, where your canvas consists of living people. It is necessary to both steer the ship yet give space for the actors to flourish their creative expression.

**Tutoring high school kids**

Tutoring teenagers to pass their final high school exams (Physics / Chemistry / Maths). This was intense, as it was 1-on-1 tutoring, but extremely rewarding. Getting the students to do their homework and aim for a seemingly distant reward is challenging, but very much worth it.

#### Languages
- English, Dutch (fluent)
- French, German, Moroccan (basic)

## Education

#### Makers Academy (05/2017 - 08/2017)
- **TDD** is a major focus at Makers; to the point where untested code won't even be considered with reviews. Writing tests for code is something that was, before starting at MA, completely
  new to me. I can thank them for my internal alarm bells ringing when coming across / writing untested or badly tested code. 
- **SOLID** is another acronym that Makers is a massive fan of; and after learning that SOLID is not just a state materials can reside in, I fully appreciate why they are.
- Makers, more than anything, has not only taught me to just write working code - more than that, they have taught me to nurture my skills carefully as any craftsman does that loves their
  skills and **sees their code as their own work of art**.
- **Agile Working** is something that I haven't had the chance of experiencing before Makers, but now software development and agile are terms that sound almost synonymous. Building your projects up from MVP, having constant communication channels as stand-ups and retros, and not being scared to diverge the initial plan if it comes to it.
