## Rita Sijelmass

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.

I have finished a BSc in Earth Sciences and an MSc in Geoscience, where I decided to mostly focus on Hydrology – the research of water. I felt it was important to understand the planet we live on. Now, I converted to the techworld as that will help me understand the future. Hopefully, I’ll be able to make it a full-time passion while being a contribution to the planet I got to know so well and cherish so deeply.
