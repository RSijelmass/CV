*A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.*

I have finished a BSc in Earth Sciences and an MSc in Geoscience, where I decided to mostly focus on Hydrology – the research of water. I felt it was important to understand the planet we live on. Now, I converted to the techworld as that will help me understand the future. Hopefully, I’ll be able to make it a full-time passion while being a contribution to the planet I got to know so well and cherish so deeply.

- Volunteering at an animal shelter: animals that have been saved from the slaughterhouse, or any other cruel environment, are cared for at the F.R.I.E.N.D. Animal Sanctuary, just outside of London. Here, I’ve spent numerous days in the weekends doing various tasks; building and/or cleaning sheds, feeding the animals, planting new crop, etc.

- a.	Hiking with a stranger across southwest of the US: after having spent half a year in New York, I really wanted to go and explore the nature the US has to offer; for this reason, I bought a ticket to San Francisco to start my journey. Because I didn’t know anyone, I contacted someone from the travelling network Couchsurfing, where I met an incredible person to share the experience with.

- Thesis Research in India. I conducted the research for my bachelor’s thesis in Chennai, India to analyse water contamination in a major wetland. Here, nothing went as planned; they took away my previously given rights to take samples in the wetland, and half of the equipment in the laboratory that was promised me didn’t function. I managed to fulfil my research and extended it nonetheless.

- Working more than full-time as a waitress. My boss was heavily understaffed after a few major illnesses, and as we knew each other personally I worked the shifts of multiple people to keep his company afloat. I did not do this because of a money incentive; everyone knows waiting tables is not one the most financially rewarding jobs. I did it because I owed it to my employer, and loyalty is of utmost importance.

#### Communication

- Director of a play. As a director, nothing is more important than communication; you are putting together your vision, where your canvas consists of living people. To bring across what you want to see and how you want to see it, from something as grand as set-design and choreography to little details as a hand-gesture or the twitch of an eye, can only be done if you know how to bring across your message to the [...] ADD LINK TO REVIEW!

- a.	Tutoring high school kids to pass their exams (Physics / Chemistry / Maths). One job I enjoyed, was tutoring kids that were about to do their final high school exams (comparable to A-levels in UK). This was intense, as it was 1-on-1 tutoring, but extremely rewarding. Getting the children to do their homework, and to get to their reward (passing) that is seemingly far away, is challenging, but very much worth it.
