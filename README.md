NAV BAR: Linkedin, Skills, Education, Professional Experience

A Full-Stack developer with a passion for science. I have finished both a BSc in Earth Sciences and an MSc in Geoscience, where I decided to mostly focus on Hydrology – the research of water. I felt it was important to understand the planet we live on. Now, I converted to the techworld as that will help me understand the future. I strive to make it a full-time passion in a place where I can be a contribution to [what the future will hold]. 

The path to becoming a developer started when touching modelling / programming tools throughout my academic [...], where we touched on technologies as MATLAB, ArcGIS,
R, MikeZero and SMS. It really took off when starting a 16-week long intense bootcamp called Makers Academy; [...experience...]. A lot of focus is places on agile working, pair programming, and test driven development.

There are two things that will make me come to work every morning with a smile: the problems at hand to solve, and the impact those solutions will bring. 

Technologies: Ruby, JavaScript, HTML / CSS 
Touched upon: MATLAB, ArcGIS, MikeZero, SMS, Node.js

## Projects

## Skills

#### Resourceful

- MSc UCL


#### Resilient

- Working at Olapic

#### Agile

- Thesis Research in India. I conducted the research for my bachelor’s thesis in Chennai, India to analyse water contamination in a major wetland. Here, nothing went as planned; they took away my previously given rights to take samples in the wetland, and half of the equipment in the laboratory that was promised me didn’t function. I managed to fulfil my research and extended it nonetheless.

#### Drive / Determination

- Working more than full-time as a waitress. My boss was heavily understaffed after a few major illnesses, and as we knew each other personally I worked the shifts of multiple people to keep his company afloat. I did not do this because of a money incentive; everyone knows waiting tables is not one the most financially rewarding jobs. I did it because I owed it to my employer, and loyalty is of utmost importance. 

- Volunteering at an animal shelter: animals that have been saved from the slaughterhouse, or any other cruel environment, are cared for at the F.R.I.E.N.D. Animal Sanctuary, just outside of London. Here, I’ve spent numerous days in the weekends doing various tasks; building and/or cleaning sheds, feeding the animals, planting new crop, etc.

#### Communication

- Director of a play. As a director, nothing is more important than communication; you are putting together your vision, where your canvas consists of living people. To bring across what you want to see and how you want to see it, from something as grand as set-design and choreography to little details as a hand-gesture or the twitch of an eye, can only be done if you know how to bring across your message to the [...] ADD LINK TO REVIEW!

- Tutoring high school kids to pass their exams (Physics / Chemistry / Maths). One job I enjoyed, was tutoring kids that were about to do their final high school exams (comparable to A-levels in UK). This was intense, as it was 1-on-1 tutoring, but extremely rewarding. Getting the children to do their homework, and to get to their reward (passing) that is seemingly far away, is challenging, but very much worth it.
